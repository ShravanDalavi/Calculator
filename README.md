# Introduction
The project is a simple yet functional web-based calculator. It features basic arithmetic operations and a dark mode toggle. The system consists of three main files: index.html for the structure, style.css for the styling, and script.js for the interactive functionality.

# System Architecture
The architecture of this system is based on the classic Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern:
•	Model: The data and business logic, which in this case are minimal as the operations are simple arithmetic evaluations.
•	View: The user interface, defined in index.html and styled by style.css.
•	Controller: The interaction logic, including the dark mode toggling, handled by script.js.

# Features
1.	Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2.	Dark Mode Toggle: Users can switch between dark and light modes.
3.	Responsive Design: The calculator layout adjusts to different screen sizes.
4.	Interactive UI: Buttons highlight when clicked, providing a tactile feel.
   
# Integration with Calculator
The system integrates the calculator functionalities within a responsive and interactive web page. The HTML structure ensures all elements are in place, CSS provides styling for an enhanced user experience, and JavaScript adds interactivity.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the creation of a functional web-based calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers basic arithmetic operations and a dark mode feature, ensuring a good user experience with a responsive design.
